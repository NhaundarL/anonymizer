# Privacy Policy — AI Anonymizer

_Last updated: January 2026_

AI Anonymizer (“the App”) is developed with privacy and security as core principles.  
This document describes how the App handles user data, including what is processed, what is stored, and what is never collected.

---

## 1. Data Collection

AI Anonymizer **does not collect, store, nor transmit any personal data**, including documents, text content, photos, contacts, browsing history, or any other sensitive information.

Documents and text anonymization are performed **locally on the device**, without any upload to external servers.

The App **does not collect:**

- Identifiable personal information
- Sensitive data
- Document content
- Chat or prompt content
- Device identifiers
- IP addresses
- Advertising IDs
- Location data
- Contacts
- Usage behavior
- Analytics for marketing or profiling

---

## 2. Data Sharing

AI Anonymizer **does not share any data** with third parties, companies, organizations, or advertisers.

No data is sold, rented, traded, analyzed externally, or used for profiling.

---

## 3. Local Processing & Offline Design

The core anonymization engine operates **offline**.  
Uploaded files (PDF, DOCX, TXT) and prompt text are processed locally and **never leave the device**.

No cloud processing is performed.

---

## 4. Optional Account (Firebase Auth)

Users may create an optional account via Firebase Authentication using email and password.  
This is strictly for:

- Keeping preferences (language, confidentiality levels)
- App usage continuity

Firebase Auth handles credentials securely over HTTPS.

We do **not store account passwords**.  
Authentication is handled directly by Firebase services.

---

## 5. Aggregated Statistical Metrics

The App may generate **anonymous aggregated metrics**, such as:

- Number of anonymized prompts
- Number of anonymized documents
- Language used
- Confidentiality level
- Country-level usage (non-identifiable)

These metrics are:

- Anonymous
- Aggregated
- Not associated to specific users
- Not used for profiling or marketing
- Not shared with third parties

These statistics are used solely to improve the App.

---

## 6. No Tracking, No Advertising, No Analytics SDK

The App does **not** include:

- Advertising SDKs
- Analytics SDKs (Google Analytics, Firebase Analytics, Mixpanel, AppsFlyer, etc.)
- Crash reporting tools that collect user data
- Third-party trackers

No advertising identifiers or device identifiers are used.

---

## 7. Data Security

All communications (Firebase Auth) are protected through standard **TLS/HTTPS encryption**.

Document processing, anonymization and local actions are not transmitted externally.

---

## 8. User Rights (GDPR / EU Users)

In accordance with GDPR, users have the right to:

- Access their data
- Request deletion of their account
- Request deletion of data

Since no personal data or document content is collected, most rights become automatically respected by design.

Account deletion can be requested directly through the App.

---

## 9. Children’s Privacy (COPPA)

AI Anonymizer is **not intended for children under 13**.  
We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.

---

## 10. External Services

The App uses Firebase Authentication for account management.  
Firebase may perform technical operations required for login.  
Firebase’s own privacy policy applies for Auth services:

https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy

No other third-party services are used.

---

## 11. Changes to This Policy

This policy may be updated if necessary. Updates will be posted publicly.

---

## 12. Contact

For privacy-related questions or account deletion requests, users may contact:

**Email:** [Support Email Here — optional]  
or directly through the App account deletion menu.
